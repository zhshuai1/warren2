## Major fix:
* use T-1 data only, find the profit is negative;
## way forward
- [ ] check some trading entries to find why it gains or loses.
- [ ] use model directly
  - [ ] if a simple rule could not make profit, the model hardly can do. Therefore, optimize the rule first until it makes profit.
- [ ] implement a real time stock decider
- [x] draw the gains and losses graph by day, stock
- [x] simulate the strategy with day going: one day you could only trade on no more than one stock.
  - [x] random
  - [x] first hit
